# RBAC - Role-Based Access Control

In Kubernetes, **Role** and **ClusterRole** are two essential resources that define sets of permissions for accessing and manipulating Kubernetes resources. They provide an authorization mechanism to control the level of access granted to users or service accounts within a cluster. While they serve a similar purpose, there are key differences between Role and ClusterRole. Let's explore each of them in detail.

## Role

A **Role** is a Kubernetes resource that defines permissions within a specific namespace. It grants access to resources and operations within that namespace only. Here are some key points about Roles:

- Roles are namespaced resources, meaning they are limited to a specific namespace.
- They are used to grant fine-grained permissions to users or service accounts within a namespace.
- Roles can be bound to users or service accounts using **RoleBindings** or **RoleRef** in **RoleBinding** resources.
- Roles specify rules that define allowed or denied operations on specific resources.
- They are primarily used for granting permissions at the namespace level.

## ClusterRole

A **ClusterRole** is a Kubernetes resource that defines permissions across the entire cluster. It grants access to resources and operations across all namespaces. Let's look at some important details about ClusterRoles:

- ClusterRoles are not namespaced resources, meaning they have a global scope and are applicable cluster-wide.
- They are used to define permissions that apply to all namespaces in the cluster.
- ClusterRoles can be bound to users or service accounts using **ClusterRoleBindings** or **RoleRef** in **ClusterRoleBinding** resources.
- ClusterRoles define rules similar to Roles but are not limited to a specific namespace.
- They are primarily used for granting permissions at the cluster level.

## Creating a Role for User "dev"

To create a Role for the user "dev," we will follow these steps:

1. Create the Role "pod-reader" with specific permissions for accessing pods and their logs within the "beebox-mobile" namespace:

```bash
kubectl create role pod-reader --verb=get,watch,list --resource=pods,pods/log -n beebox-mobile --dry-run=client -o yaml > pod-reader-role.yaml
```

The generated "pod-reader-role.yaml" file will look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: pod-reader
  namespace: beebox-mobile
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - pods
  - pods/log
  verbs:
  - get
  - watch
  - list
```

2. Apply the Role to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod-reader-role.yaml
```

3. Finally, create a RoleBinding named "pod-reader" that binds the Role "pod-reader" to the user "dev" within the "beebox-mobile" namespace:

```bash
kubectl create rolebinding pod-reader --role=pod-reader -n beebox-mobile --user=dev --dry-run=client -o yaml > pod-reader-rolebinding.yml
```

The generated "pod-reader-rolebinding.yml" file will look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: pod-reader
  namespace: beebox-mobile
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: dev
```

4. Now, with the Role and RoleBinding in place, the user "dev" will have the necessary permissions

 to access pods within the "beebox-mobile" namespace:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n beebox-mobile --kubeconfig dev-k8s-config
```

You should see that the command works as expected, demonstrating that the RoleBinding successfully bound the Role to the user "dev" within the specified namespace.
