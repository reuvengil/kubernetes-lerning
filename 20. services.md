### Kubernetes Services

Kubernetes Services are an essential mechanism for enabling communication and load balancing between pods and external clients or services within a Kubernetes cluster. They abstract the underlying pod IP addresses, providing a stable endpoint for other services or clients to access the pods.

Key points about Kubernetes Services:
- Services provide a stable IP address and DNS name that other services can use to access pods, regardless of their dynamic IPs.
- Services can load balance traffic among multiple pods, improving application availability and scalability.
- There are different types of services to expose pods to different types of external or internal access.

### Service Types

#### 1. ClusterIP:
`ClusterIP` is the **default** service type. It expose applications **inside** the cluster network. Use them when your clients will be other Pods within the cluster,
which mean the service is going to be consumed by other pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

#### 2. NodePort:
`NodePort` exposes the service on a specific port on each node in the cluster. This makes the service accessible from outside the cluster by using `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`. It also preserves the `ClusterIP`, so the service can be accessed internally as well.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30080
  type: NodePort
```

#### 3. LoadBalancer:
`LoadBalancer` is a cloud provider-specific service type that provisions an external load balancer in front of the service. This allows external clients to access the service using a public IP, and the load balancer distributes traffic among the pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

#### 4. ExternalName:
`ExternalName` is a service type that doesn't define any selector or cluster IP. Instead, it provides a CNAME record to map the service to an external DNS name. It's mainly used for accessing services that reside outside the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: my-external-service.example.com
```

Each service type offers specific use cases and flexibility to expose your applications in Kubernetes based on your requirements.

Note: For `LoadBalancer` to work, your Kubernetes cluster needs to be running in a cloud provider that supports load balancer provisioning, such as AWS, GCP, or Azure.

## DNS - FQDN

Assuming you have a service named `my-service` running in the `my-namespace` namespace, the FQDN to access it would be:

```
my-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local
```

For example, if you have a pod running in the same namespace (`my-namespace`) and you want to access the `my-service`, you can use the FQDN in your application or command:

```bash
curl http://my-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local
```

Kubernetes automatically sets up DNS resolution for services within the cluster, and the `<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local` format is used to access services from within the same cluster. This FQDN will be automatically resolved to the correct ClusterIP of the `my-service` in the `my-namespace` namespace, and the request will be directed to that service.
