# Upgrade k8s

### Upgrade the control-plane
To upgrade the control-plane, follow these steps:

1. Access the **`control-plane`** and execute the following commands to upgrade it:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update && \
   sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubeadm=1.22.2-00
   ```
   These commands will update the kubeadm version, even if it was in helm mode.
   
2. Drain the **`control-plane`** by running the command:
   ```
   kubectl drain k8s-control --ignore-daemonsets
   ```
   
3. Once the control-plane is drained, run the following command:
   ```
   sudo kubeadm upgrade plan 1.22.2-00
   ```
   
4. Apply the upgrade by executing the command:
   ```
   sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.22.2
   ```
   
5. Update kubectl and kubelet by running the commands:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update && \
   sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubelet=1.22.2-00 kubectl=1.22.2-00
   ```
   
6. To ensure that the currently running version is 1.22.2-00, enter the following commands:
   ```
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart kubelet
   ```
   
7. Uncordon the drained k8s-control using the command:
   ```
   kubectl uncordon k8s-control
   ```
   
8. To verify that you are running the upgraded version, execute the command:
   ```
   kubectl get nodes
   ```
   The expected output should be:
   ```
   NAME          STATUS   ROLES                   AGE   VERSION
   k8s-control   Ready    control-plane,master   29m   v1.22.2
   k8s-worker1   Ready    <none>                 28m   v1.22.0
   k8s-worker2   Ready    <none>                 28m   v1.22.0
   ```

### Upgrade a single worker node
To upgrade a single worker node, follow these steps:

1. Drain the **`worker node`** by running the command on the control-plane terminal:
   ```
   kubectl drain k8s-worker1 --ignore-daemonsets --force
   ```
   
2. After the **`worker node`** is drained, go to the terminal of k8s-worker1 and execute the following commands to upgrade it:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update && \
   sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubeadm=1.22.2-00
   ```
   
3. Run the command ```kubeadm version``` to verify the new version number.
   
4. Execute the command:
   ```
   sudo kubeadm upgrade node
   ```
   
5. Then run the commands:
   ```
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart kubelet
   ```
   
6. Return to the **`control-plane`** and uncordon the upgraded node by running the command:
   ```
   kubectl uncordon k8s-worker1
   ```
   
7. Repeat the same steps for k8s-worker2.
   
That's it!
