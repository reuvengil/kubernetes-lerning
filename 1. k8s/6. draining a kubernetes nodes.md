## What is draining?
When performing maintence, you may somtimes need to remove a Kubernetice node frome service.

To do this, you can **`drain`** the node.
Containers running on the node will be gracefully terminated (and potentially rescheduled on anoter node).

To drain a node, use the kubectl command:
```html
kubctl drain <node name>
```
### Ignoring DeamonSets
When drainig a node, you may need to ignore DeamonSets (pods that are tied to each node).
If you have any DeamonSets pods running on the node, you will likely need to use the `--ignore-deamonsets` flag.
```html
kubctl drain <node name> --ignore-deamonsets
```
### Uncordoing a Node
If the node remains part of the cluster, you can allow pods to run on the node again when maintence is complete using the kubectl command:
```html
kubctl uncordon <node name>
```
After learning how to drain and uncordon a nodes, lets practice that.
