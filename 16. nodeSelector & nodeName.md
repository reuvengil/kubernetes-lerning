### `nodeName`

`nodeName` is a field that can be specified in a pod's YAML file to assign the pod to a specific node in the Kubernetes cluster. It overrides the default scheduling mechanism of Kubernetes and ensures that the pod runs only on the specified node.

Here's an example YAML file (`pod-with-nodename.yaml`) for creating a pod with `nodeName`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-nodename
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
  nodeName: <node-name>
```

In this YAML file, replace `<node-name>` with the name of the node where you want to schedule the pod. When you apply this YAML file using `kubectl apply -f pod-with-nodename.yaml`, the pod will be scheduled only on the specified node.

### `nodeSelector`

`nodeSelector` is another mechanism to influence pod scheduling in Kubernetes. It allows you to specify key-value pairs that must match labels assigned to nodes. Pods with a matching `nodeSelector` are eligible to be scheduled on those labeled nodes.

To demonstrate `nodeSelector`, let's assume you have two worker nodes labeled as `spacil=true` and `spacil=false` respectively.

First, label the nodes using the `kubectl label` command:

```bash
kubectl label nodes <node-name> spacil=true
kubectl label nodes <node-name> spacil=false
```

Next, create a YAML file (`pod-with-nodeselector.yaml`) for a pod that uses `nodeSelector`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-nodeselector
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
  nodeSelector:
    spacil: "true"
```

In this YAML file, we specify `nodeSelector` with `spacil: "true"`, which matches the label assigned to one of the nodes.

Apply the YAML file using `kubectl apply -f pod-with-nodeselector.yaml`, and the pod will be scheduled on the node with the label `spacil=true`.

That's it! You now have two separate YAML files, one using `nodeName` and the other using `nodeSelector`, along with explanations for each scenario.
