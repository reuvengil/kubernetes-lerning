## Resource Requests
In Kubernetes, **`Resource Requests`** are used to specify the minimum amount of computational resources (such as CPU and memory) that a container needs to run. When you define resource requests for a container, you are requesting the Kubernetes scheduler to allocate those resources to the container's Pod on a node that meets the requested criteria. This is an essential aspect of resource management in Kubernetes to ensure that your applications have the necessary resources to function properly without being starved or throttled.


Memory is measured in bytes. CPU is measured in CPU units, which are 1/1000 one CPU.

Resource Requests are specified at the container level within a Pod's specification. Here's how you define resource requests in a Pod:
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: my-image
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "100m"    # 100 milliCPU units (0.1 CPU core)
          memory: "256Mi" # 256 Mebibytes (MiB)

```
## Resource Limits
In Kubernetes, **`Resource Limits`** are used to specify the maximum amount of computational resources (such as CPU and memory) that a container is allowed to consume. Setting resource limits is important for ensuring that a container does not use more resources than it is supposed to, which helps prevent resource contention and ensures fair resource allocation within the cluster.

Resource Limits are specified at the container level within a Pod's specification, just like Resource Requests. Here's how you define resource limits in a Pod:
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: my-image
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "100m"    # 100 milliCPU units (0.1 CPU core)
          memory: "256Mi" # 256 Mebibytes (MiB)
        limits:
          cpu: "200m"    # 200 milliCPU units (0.2 CPU core)
          memory: "512Mi" # 512 Mebibytes (MiB)
```
