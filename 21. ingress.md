### Kubernetes

Kubernetes Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services within a Kubernetes cluster. It acts as a single entry point for external traffic and provides a way to configure routing rules to direct incoming requests to the appropriate services. Ingress resources work in tandem with an Ingress controller, which is responsible for fulfilling the Ingress rules.

#### Key Points about Kubernetes Ingress:

- Ingress is used to manage external access to services in a cluster.
- It provides a way to route traffic based on rules defined in the Ingress resource.
- Ingress resources work with an Ingress controller to handle incoming traffic.

#### Example with Service Type ClusterIP:

Assuming you have a Service with the type `ClusterIP` named `my-service` in the namespace `my-namespace`, and you want to expose it externally using Ingress:

1. First, ensure you have an Ingress controller deployed in your cluster. Ingress controllers like Nginx Ingress or Traefik are commonly used to manage Ingress resources. You can check the documentation of your Ingress controller for installation instructions.

2. Next, create an Ingress resource to route traffic to your `my-service`:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  rules:
  - host: my-domain.com #if you have domain name
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /my-service
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              name: http-port
```

In this example:

- We create an Ingress resource named `my-ingress` in the namespace `my-namespace`.
- We specify a rule that routes incoming traffic with the hostname `my-domain.com` to our `my-service`.
- The `/my-service` path is mapped to the `my-service` with the port named `http-port`.

3. Now, let's define the `my-service` itself:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - name: http-port
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

In this `my-service` definition:

- We create a Service named `my-service` in the namespace `my-namespace`.
- The service selects pods with the label `app: my-app`.
- The service exposes port 80 internally (`port: 80`), and it forwards traffic to the pods on port 8080 (`targetPort: 8080`).

4. When an incoming request arrives with the host `my-domain.com/my-service`, the Ingress controller will route the traffic to the `my-service` within the `my-namespace`.

Note: For this example to work, you would need to have a DNS entry pointing `my-domain.com` to the IP address of your Ingress controller's external load balancer or NodePort (depending on your setup). Additionally, ensure that your Ingress controller is properly configured and running in your cluster.
