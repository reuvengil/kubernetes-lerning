## Kubectl Tips

Here are some useful tips for working with kubectl:

1. `--dry-run`: Use this command to create a Kubernetes object YAML file without actually creating the object. For example:
   ```
   kubectl create deployment my-deployment --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > deployment.yaml
   ```
   This command generates the deployment YAML file `deployment.yaml` for the nginx image. You can modify the file as needed before applying it.

2. `--record`: Use the `--record` flag to record a command. For example:
   ```
   kubectl scale deployment my-deployment --replicas=5 --record
   ```
   This command scales the deployment to 5 replicas and records the operation.

   To view the recorded command, use the following command:
   ```
   kubectl describe deployment my-deployment
   ```
   Under the **`Annotations`** section, you can see all the recorded commands.
3. `exec`: use this to exec container inside a pod like this:
   ```
   kubectl exec busybox -- echo hello world
   ```
By utilizing these kubectl tips, you can create YAML files for Kubernetes objects without making changes to the cluster, and also keep track of recorded commands for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
