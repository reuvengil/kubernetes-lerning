### DaemonSets

A DaemonSet in Kubernetes is a type of workload that ensures that a specific pod runs on all or a subset of nodes in the cluster. It is useful for deploying system-level daemons, log collectors, or monitoring agents that need to be available on each node.

Key characteristics of DaemonSets:
- It runs exactly one copy of a pod on each node or a subset of nodes.
- When new nodes are added to the cluster, the DaemonSet automatically schedules pods on those nodes.
- When nodes are removed from the cluster, the corresponding pods are also terminated.

DaemonSets are commonly used for tasks that require node-specific operations, such as logging, monitoring, or network setup.

### Example YAML for a DaemonSet

Here's a simple example of a DaemonSet YAML file (`daemonset.yaml`) that deploys an Nginx web server on all nodes in the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

In this YAML file, we define a DaemonSet named `nginx-daemonset`. The `selector` field selects nodes based on their labels, and the `template` field specifies the pod template to be deployed on each node.

The pod template includes an Nginx container, which listens on port 80.

When you apply this DaemonSet using `kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml`, it will deploy an Nginx pod on every node in the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring the Nginx web server is running on each node.

Note: It's important to be cautious while deploying DaemonSets, especially on large clusters, as running multiple instances of pods on each node can consume significant resources. Always ensure that your cluster can handle the additional workload before deploying a DaemonSet.
