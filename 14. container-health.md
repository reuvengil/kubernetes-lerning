# Container Health Part I: Understanding Kubernetes Probes

In Kubernetes, probes are used to determine the health and availability of containers running inside a Pod. They enable Kubernetes to make informed decisions about when to start, stop, or restart containers based on their current status. There are three types of probes: Liveness Probes, Startup Probes, and Readiness Probes.

## Liveness Probes

**Liveness Probes** are used to check whether a container is running properly. Kubernetes periodically sends a request to the container, and if the probe fails to receive a response within a specified timeframe or the response indicates a failure, the container is considered unhealthy. When a container fails the liveness probe, Kubernetes will restart it to attempt to recover the application.

Example of a Liveness Probe using an HTTP GET request:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  periodSeconds: 10
```

In this example, Kubernetes will send an HTTP GET request to `/healthz` on port 8080, starting 15 seconds after the container starts. The probe will be repeated every 10 seconds.

## Full Example Of Pod With A Liveness Probe
Here's a full example of a Pod with a liveness probe defined using an HTTP probe:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-app-container
      image: my-app-image
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /health
          port: 8080
        initialDelaySeconds: 15
        periodSeconds: 10
```

## Startup Probes

**Startup Probes** are used to delay the readiness status of a container until it has completed its initialization process. The probe runs only once when the container starts and helps to prevent premature traffic routing to a container that might still be initializing.

Example of a Startup Probe using an HTTP GET request:

```yaml
startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
```

In this example, the Startup Probe sends an HTTP GET request to `/ready` on port 8080, starting 30 seconds after the container starts. The result of this probe will determine whether the container is marked as ready or not.

## Readiness Probes

**Readiness Probes** are used to determine if a container is ready to accept incoming requests. It checks whether a container is prepared to handle traffic and helps Kubernetes to decide if the Pod should receive client requests.

Example of a Readiness Probe using an HTTP GET request:

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
```

In this example, Kubernetes will send an HTTP GET request to `/ready` on port 8080, starting 10 seconds after the container starts. The probe will be repeated every 5 seconds.

# Container Health Part II: Building Self-Healing Pods with Restart Policies
We've already talked about using probes to detect container failures, **`Restart Policies`** basically control what happens once we detect that a container is unhealthy.

There are three possible values for a pod's restart policy in k8s: **Always**, **OnFailure**, and **Never**.

### **Always**
Always is the default restart policy in k8s, with this policy containers will always be restarted if thay stopped, even if they completed successfully. 

### **OnFailure**
The **OnFailure** restart the containers only if the container  procces exits with an error code or the container is determined to be unhealthy by a liveness probe.
### **Never**
The **Never** restart policy will cause the pod's container to never be restarted.

Exmple of using restartPolicy:
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: always-pod
spec:
  restartPolicy: Always
    containers:
    - name: busybox
      image: busybox
      command: ['sh','-c','sleep 10']
```
